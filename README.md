This is a test for demand. I've built a nice interface around FreeAgent's API in our Rails application and would gladly take the time to abstract it into a Gem that everyone can use but only if there is enough demand.

**So, if you want to use this Gem, Star this project and if it gets enough attention I'll carve out time on a weekend and get it done.**

Thanks,

Josh
