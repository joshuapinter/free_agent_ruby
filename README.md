# FreeAgent Ruby

This is test for demand. I've built a nice interface around FreeAgent's API in our Rails application and would gladly take the time to abstract it into a Gem that everyone can use if there is enough demand. 

So, if you want to use this Gem, Star this project and if it gets enough attention I'll carve out time on a weekend and get it done.

Much Love, 

Josh
